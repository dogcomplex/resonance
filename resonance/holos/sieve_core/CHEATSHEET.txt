NOT ALL THIS IS GOSPEL OR INTERNALLY CONSISTENT.  FIND THE COHERENCE AND ELEGANCE.  STAY TRUE TO REAL PHYSICS, THESE ARE JUST WAYPOINTS


PHYSICS
- let known reality guide all.
- thesis: most efficient exploration/search/learning IS physics (and vice versa)
- let elegance be your guide, backed by performance benchmarks

SIEVES
- single sieve pattern, N dimensional
- IS geography (space))
- IS fidelity (scale)
- IS temporal (time)
- IS probability (many worlds)
- IS all combinations thereof (higher-order rules)
- IS discrete rule resolution
- IS analog wave dynamics

SHEAVES
- all operations are universal
- all is ultimately one operation
- LHS => RHS in discrete causal logic
- map to analog equivalent

ANALOG
- FFT equivalence to digital
- reservoir computing
- optical co-processor
- saturable absorber + amplifier loop = layers

HOLOGRAPHIC
- infinite memory, limited signal
- Higgs field
- unitarity (strong bet on this holding)


WAVES
- everything's a wave
- lightning = few-shot, fast
- osmosis = step by step
- wave = BFS
- crystalization = local search
- 1D wave medium => N-Dimensional physics
- sensus

INDUCTION
- is wave interference between:
- forward wave = DEDUCTION (+1?)
- backward wave = ABDUCTION (-1?)
- IS rule discovery
- IS creation of complexity?

RULES:
- LHS => RHS
- A B => B C  catalysts=conditionals=membranes=interiors
- sieve
- works for analog too
- games, tictactoe, chess, etc all map to this
- priorities are conditionals (universe ordering)
- matter

CURRYING
- all rules are just one rule  A B => C
- C => A B is just a twist (anti-rule)
- sheaves
- xor?

VORTEX
- spin
- early rules form direction
- spiral
- magnetic fields arise from vortex rotation of Plank mass dipoles.  field lines reflect spin axis alignment.  flux lines are closed-loop vortical filaments.  Alternating LH/RH spins create electric polarization.  E-fields = scalar potential superposition.  B-fields = curl
- ring torus vortex.  Vortex in, vortex out  (brief interiority?)



TERNARY
- +1 (matter) -1 (antimatter) 0 (vacuum)
- temperature is frequency on the waveform
- amplitude is net magnetization
- energy is total excitation
- matmult = addition
- gpu/computation loves it
- annihilation +1 -1 => 0
- sheaves


ANTIMATTER
- PI twist on phase
- DEATH
- failed game states

SURVIVAL
- IS reward
- IS rules with futures reinforcing past
- no explicit reward needed.  just rule interactions
- future carries info to past via rule interference

QUANTUM
- just non-locality
- explore all worlds balanced
- lazy
- emulated in classic wavefunction:  poor_mans_quantum.txt
- appears as if just a faster medium faster than wave function on slower medium (with 2-phase waves)


INTERIORITY
- rules are boundaries
- Weak Force
- locus interior, signum interface
- atoms are interiors
- ZK proofs, encryption
- broken by enough energy/compute to find the combination
- resonant cavities


LOOPS
- Strong Force
- braids
- knot theory

CHAOS
- randomness begets rules
- random waves beget patterns
- periodic table of surviving rules
- patterns beget patterns
- pseudorandom patterns beget patterns
- different rules/patterns per chaos signature
- hawking radiation in final stages
- 42
- 6 7
- mark of the beast

- functors, sheaves
- chomsky hierarchy
